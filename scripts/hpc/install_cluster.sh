# script only needs the two `source` lines at the end of this file.

# The one thing that matters: mpi4py must be COMPILED against the MPI that
# srun/mpirun will launch. The binary wheel from PyPI bundles its own MPI
# and, on a cluster, either fails to start or silently runs N independent
# copies of the job. Load the MPI module first, then build from source.
