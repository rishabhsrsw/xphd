"""Mirror parity of the electronic bands, along a path and over the zone.

In a planar layer sigma_h is a symmetry at every in-plane k, so every Bloch
state is even or odd under it, and that parity is the diagonal of the sigma_h
rotation matrix LetzElPhC already wrote to Dmats.npy:

    p_n(k) = <psi_nk | sigma_h | psi_nk> = D^{sigma_h}_{nn}(k) = +-1 .

This is the band-level input to every exciton parity in the package. The
exciton character is chi_S(Q) = sum_kvc |A|^2 p_c(k+Q) p_v(k), so wherever a
band changes parity along k, an exciton drawing on it can change parity too
-- this is what produces the parity domains of `xphd parity`.

Band indices are energy-ordered, so where two bands of opposite parity cross,
the band called n changes colour although no single state changed: a colour
flip marks a crossing. Where two DEGENERATE bands of opposite parity come back
in a mixed basis, the diagonal is no longer +-1 and the off-diagonal is not
small; such points are reported as undetermined rather than forced to a sign.

Only the bands of the Bethe-Salpeter window are covered, since Dmats holds
rotation matrices for those alone -- which are also the bands the excitons are
built from. The values are exact on the source mesh; along a high-symmetry
path only the mesh points lying on it exist (25 on Gamma-M-K-Gamma of a 24x24
mesh). The energies are Kohn-Sham, from ns.db1; the parity does not depend on
the quasiparticle correction.

    |p| ~ 1 and off ~ 0; a mixed degenerate pair has both near 1/sqrt(2).

    For spinors (spin-orbit), sigma_h squares to -1 and the eigenvalues are
    +-i: the labels are then taken from the imaginary part (see
    xphd.mirror.band_labels), so that an exciton's parity is still
    label_c * label_v. At time-reversal-invariant points (Gamma, M) each
